Dear Workshop Organizers,
I am writing to express my interest in the Health Research Data and Metadata Management, Train the Trainers Workshop that will be held at the Kamuzu University of Health Sciences.
I just started working as a data science officer for the cancer program where mainly my job will be focused on creating and managing data repositories for the research program. 
This workshop will be very helpful to me in my professional career because it will help improve my skills in managing the cancer research data and the research data repositories. This workshop will also serve a great opportunity in broadening my professional network hence this workshop is a special added value.
Before working as a data science officer, I was working as a data associate at the same project, so I have quite some experiences with data and metadata management. As a data associate I was collecting and sorting related and required data within the site. 
I would highly appreciate to be given an opportunity to attend this workshop gathering for it will be good for my professional career.
I also have full funding support from my organization. 
Sincerely,

Tarsizious Chikaonda
